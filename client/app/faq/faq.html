                        <p>It's easy to sign up and send a poorly thought out email to hundreds of agents but to be more effective, take the time to research who you're submitting to. There is no sense in submitting to a top tier agency without a single co-star credit.</p>

The list we give you is a great starting place, but do your research, add your own contacts to your list, and change things around.</p>

                        <p>The settings page is just to set a date for you to be reminded when you would like to send the next email. It will not actually send that template on that day.
                            All it will do is send you an email to remind you to log in, do some touch up perhaps, and send it manually.
                            It would be easy enough to schedule the second, third, and fourth email to auto send on a specific date but a lot can happen between submissions.
                            If you'd like this changed or think there is a better way to do it, please message me!

                        <p> The plans are pretty simple. There are four of them. The only difference is how many people you can send submissions to. So the length of your list is limited based on which plan you choose.
                        You can send each template to the entire list. You will not be able to upload a new list or add to the list after the first email template is sent. You will be able to manage the current list, and delete elements from it.</p>
